# Using Animations  

The following program goes over a few of the concepts that we have explored in the past regarding Python and Pygame.

Explore the existing program code in `main.py`, `constants.py`, and `spritesheet_functions.py`.  

Then, modify the contents of the code to have 4 walls that your own chosen character cannot escape.

## Objectives
1. Use either `log.png` or `NPC_test.png` from the **images** folder, or your own sprite sheet to call in your own character object to the game.
     * You can use the existing code in `main.py` to help you
     * You will need to find the sprite sheet coordinates for your new character (using software such as **Piskel**)
2. Define **four** wall objects along the edges of the screen that the character object cannot pass through (the character must stay on screen!)
3. Add some `text` to the screen - this can be anything you want

### Bonus
* Can you figure out how to load up up one of the items or objects in any of the other sprite sheets, such as the fountain in `Overworld.png`?
