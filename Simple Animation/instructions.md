# Simple Animations

A simple program to show how you can animate images in Pygame.
For this example, four character directional images are loaded into the program, added to a list, and looped through so that it gives the illusion of movement.
This is linked to an event listener, as gone over in previous lessons.  When the user presses the "K" key, the animation is played.
If the user lets go of the key, the animation stops and resets to the original image.

Using Sprite Sheets, you can pull images from a single file instead of loading up multiple images.  This can save time, and memory for your programs.
We will be going over this concept during our next lesson.
